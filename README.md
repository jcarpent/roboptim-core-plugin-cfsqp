roboptim-core-plugin-csfsqp
===========================

This plug-in wraps the CFSQP solver as a RobOptim plug-in. As CFSQP
sources are directly included into this package, this repository
cannot be released publicly.

If you have a valid CFSQP licence, please contact directly thomas DOT
moulard AT gmail DOT com with a proof that you possess a valid CFSQP
licence. A copy of the last release will then be sent to you. Please
note that this process is manual and may take some time depending on
how busy I am.

For other questions regarding RobOptim or this plug-in, please use
directly our Google Group: roboptim@googlegroups.com

If you encountered an issue with this plug-in, please post your
problem on this project tracker while avoiding showing off
confidential information (i.e. CFSQP sources).
